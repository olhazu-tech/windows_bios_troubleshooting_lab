This is the main page of the Dell G7 BIOS interface.  
It lists all available configuration categories such as System Information, Boot Sequence, Security, and Virtualization Support.  
I often started here when running system diagnostics or preparing a machine to boot from external media during installations.  

Don reminds me from the very beginning that he has my hand to quide me through the process ‚Äî or maybe I have his ‚Äî in case I need any help. üêæ
