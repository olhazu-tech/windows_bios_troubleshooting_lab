This is the main page of the Dell G7 BIOS interface.  
It lists all available configuration categories such as System Information, Boot Sequence, Security, and Virtualization Support.  
I often started here when running system diagnostics or preparing a machine to boot from external media during installations.  

Don, my cat, reminds me from the very beginning that he has my hand to guide me through the process ‚Äî or maybe I have his ‚Äî in case I need any help. üêæ
